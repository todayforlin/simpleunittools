      <p>
        SimpleUnitTools does not ask you to create an account and does not collect personal information directly.
        Like most websites, basic analytics and hosting logs may record standard technical data (such as IP address,
        browser type, and pages visited) to help improve site performance and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        If advertising is enabled in the future (e.g., Google AdSense), third-party vendors may use cookies or similar
        technologies to serve ads based on visits to this and other websites.
