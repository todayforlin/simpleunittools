      <h1>What Does dB Mean?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>dB</strong> stands for <strong>decibel</strong>.
        It is a logarithmic unit used to measure sound level or signal strength.
      </p>

      <h2>Why dB Is Logarithmic</h2>
      <p>
        The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.
        This means a small increase in dB represents a large increase in sound energy.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Sound Levels in dB</h2>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <th>Sound Source</th>
          <th>Sound Level (dB)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Whisper</td><td>30 dB</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Normal conversation</td><td>60 dB</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Vacuum cleaner</td><td>70 dB</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Busy traffic</td><td>85 dB</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Motorcycle</td><td>95 dB</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Rock concert</td><td>110 dB</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>What a 10 dB Increase Means</h2>
      <p>
        Every <strong>10 dB</strong> increase is perceived as roughly
        <strong>twice as loud</strong> to the human ear.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>70 dB feels about twice as loud as 60 dB.</li>
        <li>85 dB is the level where hearing damage can begin.</li>
        <li>100 dB can cause hearing damage after short exposure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
      <p>
        A common mistake is assuming dB increases linearly.
        Because it is logarithmic, the scale grows very quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Is 80 dB twice as loud as 40 dB?</strong> No. The increase is much larger due to the logarithmic scale.</p>
      <p><strong>What dB level is safe?</strong> Long-term exposure above 85 dB can damage hearing.</p>
      <p><strong>Is dB only for sound?</strong> No. dB is also used for signal strength and power ratios.</p>
